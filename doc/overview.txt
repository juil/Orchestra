A 5 Minute Guide to Orcehstra
-----------------------------

What is it?
===========

Orchestra is a series of tools for Getting Shit Run.

It consists of a Conductor, which is the coordinating process, and
Players, which are the actual daemons running on nodes to do the work.

To prevent arbitrary execution of code, Players can only execute
predefined scores which have to be installed on them seperately.  You
can use puppet, cfengine or other configuration management system to
do this.

Canonically, entities requesting work to be done are known as the
Audience.

Please read the Orchestra paper (in doc/) for more information.

Building
========

Install the Go Release 59 compiler.

From the top level directory, run make.  It will use goinstall to
build the binaries in bin/

Source Layout
=============

src/	 -- All the go sources for the conductor, player, and the 
	   submitjob and getstatus sample implementations.

doc/	 -- Documentation about Orchestra and it's implementation.

samples/ -- Sample configuration files.

clientlibs/ -- Sample client libraries for communicating with the
	       Conductor as the Audience.

New In This Release
===================

v0.2.0:
 * First public release.

Known Issues
============

 * There is no clean up of job data, or persistance of results at this
   time.  This is intended to be implemented as soon as time permits.

 * getstatus gets back a lot more information than it displays.

 * No efficient 'wait for job' interface yet.  You have to poll the
   audience interface for completion results for now.  (The polls are,
   however, stupidly cheap)

 * Disconnect/Reconnect behaviour for players is not particualrly well
   tested.  Annecdotal evidence suggests that this is relatively
   robust however.

 * Jobs will be left dangling if a player is removed from the
   conductor's configuration and the conductor HUP'd whilst there is
   still work pending for that player.

 * Some of the more advanced score scheduling ideas that we've had
   remain unimplemented, resulting in Orchestra looking a lot blander
   than it really is meant to be.
